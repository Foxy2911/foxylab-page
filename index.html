                    Welcome to my website! This website is self-hosted on my own home lab.
                    A home lab is a place where you can try out new things and 
                    learn new technologies or new vendor equipment in the comfort of your own home.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    My purpose for my home lab is to keep it more eco-friendly and power efficient.
                    At the moment my home lab exists out of 1 thin client that is hosting this website.
                    It is also hosting my personal storage server and projects too.
                </p>
